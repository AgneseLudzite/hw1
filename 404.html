    <h1>CALIFORNIA NATIONAL PARKS</h1>
</header>
<p>California features several National Parks spread across the state that offer a myriad of climates, wildlife, and natural features. From Yosemite’s Half Dome to Joshua Tree’s Cholla Garden to the world’s tallest trees in Redwood, California’s National Parks hold something special for everyone. But the varied elevations and climates of these giant state parks mean that the time of year you go really matters.</p>

<p>Here are <strong>the best</strong> California National Parks to visit during a summer road trip, while in an Escape Campervan.</p>
<h2>Lassen Volcanic National Park</h2>
<p>This northern California park is open year-round, but late summer is the best time to go if you want access to all areas of the park. Hiking to the summit of Lassen Peak is best done in summer, as snow and avalanche danger often persists throughout the spring, and trails often stay muddy into July. Catch the high-elevation wildflower season from July through September and then take a dip in a cool mountain lake.</p>
<h2>Redwood National Park</h2>
<p>If you are hoping to stay out of the heat this summer, Redwood National Park is the northern California park for you. On the redwood coast, summer daytime temperatures hover in the mid-to-upper-60s and rarely get up to 70℉. The world’s three tallest trees call this park home, as do the many sea creatures you can find in the park's coastal tide pools. In the summer months, you can join a ranger-led kayak tour down the Smith River.</p>

<h2>Yosemite National Park</h2>
<p>Yosemites huge granite formations and mountain lakes are spectacular any time of year, but like the other parks mentioned here, more accessible in the summer. Large swaths of the park are closed in winter, so summer is the time to get into the higher elevations and less populated parts of the park. Yosemite is vast and beautiful but sometimes crowded. In fact, during the summer months, you now need a permit to enter the park, so check the Yosemite website to plan far ahead of your trip.</p>

<h2>Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks</h2>
<p>These connected central California parks are also at high elevations, making them most accessible in the summer. Among several ancient sequoia groves, you can find the largest living sequoia and bask in the shade these majestic giants offer. These parks also offer a variety of hikes, mountain lakes, and river activities.</p>
